# todo
- when someone logs in later, let them have all the data (server-side rendering of first view)
- add a graph
  - plain api call every second to update the graph
  - rough idea: setTimeout(() => fetch(graphUrl).then(data => updateGraph(data)), 1000)
- publish on heroku
- manage state (maybe try https://github.com/typicode/lowdb)
